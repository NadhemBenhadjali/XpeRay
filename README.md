# XpeRay
XpeRay is a fine-tuned vision-language model built on top of Unsloth's FastVisionModel using LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct (4-bit), trained to generate professional radiology reports from medical images. The project leverages GPU memory-efficient training techniques and integrates evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore.
