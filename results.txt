Ground Truth: Image of a nodule with peripheral calcifications and acoustic shadowing that obscures its central content. According to the ACR TI-RADS, when the internal characteristics of a nodule cannot be determined because of acoustic shadowing, it is prudent to assume that it is solid and to assign it 2 points for composition, as well as 1 point for echogenicity. In this case, the nodule was assigned 2 points for being of indeterminate composition, 1 point for being of indeterminate echogenicity, 0 points for being wider-than-tall, 2 points for having lobulated margins, and 2 points for having peripheral calcifications. Therefore, the total score was 7 points and the risk level was classified as TR5.

Ground Truth: Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.
